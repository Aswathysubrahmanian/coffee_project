            <p>Several studies show that caffeine can increase fat burning and boost your metabolic rate.</p>
            <li>Can Drastically Improve Physical Performance</li>
            <p>Caffeine can increase adrenaline levels and release fatty acids from your fat tissues. It also leads to
                significant improvements in physical performance.</p>
            <li>Contains Essential Nutrients</li>
            <p>Coffee contains several important nutrients, including riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese,
